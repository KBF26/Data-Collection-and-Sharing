# Data-Collection-and-Sharing
In this project I collected a dataset (anonymous questionnaire) for my Statistics of Information Science class. I asked 10 people these questions:

Q1: There is widespread mental health epidemics, problems such as depression and anxiety and many more. But WHY? In our opinion, what is the leading cause and what is the second-leading cause of this collective increase? For each of them can you briefly mention how that factor leads to a mental health problem?

Q2: What is your favorite thing about the modern human life, what is your second-favorite thing, and what is your least-favorite thing?

Q3: Name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of mothers specifically.

Q4: Name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of fathers specifically. 

Q5: Name the biggest factor that, in our opinion, today, harms the mental health of children specifically. 


All these questions don't have a right or wrong answer it is based on the 10 people's interpretion of the questions! Collecting data is very important in statistics and data science.
